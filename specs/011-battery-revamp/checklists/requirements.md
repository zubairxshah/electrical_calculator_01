# Specification Quality Checklist: Battery Calculator Revamp

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`.
- Validation result (2026-06-21): all items pass on first iteration.
  - No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers were needed — the user's direction plus documented Assumptions resolved every ambiguity with a reasonable default (EOL 80%/1.25, NEC as safety guidance, small curated datasheet library, OCR/AI as phase-2 stretch).
  - Implementation-flavored terms in the source request (file paths, formula) were deliberately kept out of the spec body and deferred to the plan; the spec describes *what*/*why* only.
  - Standards are named (IEEE 485, IEC, NEC) as domain requirements, not implementation choices, consistent with the rest of the ElectroMate specs.
