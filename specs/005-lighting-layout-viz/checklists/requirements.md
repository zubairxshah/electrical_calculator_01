# Specification Quality Checklist: Interactive Room Layout Visualization for Lighting Design

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (7 stories covering visualization, layout algorithm, accuracy, suggestions, export, presets, customization)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

- All 7 user stories have P1/P2/P3 priorities assigned
- Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format for testability
- Edge cases cover invalid inputs, edge conditions, and error scenarios
- Dependencies reference existing project files correctly
- Assumptions document reasonable defaults used
- Research notes cite ToolsRail.com as the reference implementation

## Checklist Status: ✅ COMPLETE

Specification is ready for `/sp.plan` phase.
