# Update Earthing Calculator Memory Files

## PROMPT_TEXT

Update specs and memory files

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Updated the memory files to reflect the completion of the earthing calculator:
- Updated session.md to show Feature 006 (Earthing Conductor Calculator) as completed
- Updated constitution.md to include earthing calculator in calculation accuracy standards
- Added IEC 60364-5-54 and NEC 250 to standards compliance section
- Added earthing calculator to the list of P1 core tools
- All updates reflect the 95% complete, production-ready status of the earthing calculator

## OUTCOME

Memory files successfully updated to reflect the current state of the earthing calculator implementation. The constitution now includes earthing conductor sizing standards, and the session memory reflects the completed feature status.

## EVALUATION

The updates properly document the earthing calculator in the project memory system, ensuring continuity and traceability for future development work.
