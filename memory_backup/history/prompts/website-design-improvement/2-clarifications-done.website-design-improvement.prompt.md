# Prompt History Record: clarifications-done

## PROMPT_TEXT


## RESPONSE_TEXT

Completed clarification process for website design improvement feature. Five critical questions were addressed: 1) Error/empty states handling - defined for all UI components, 2) Observability requirements - added comprehensive logging and tracing, 3) Accessibility compliance - maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, 4) Performance targets - target 60fps on mid-range devices, 5) Responsive design - use standard breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl). The spec was updated with these clarifications in a new Clarifications section and the functional/non-functional requirements were adjusted accordingly.
